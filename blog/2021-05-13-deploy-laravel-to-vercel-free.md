> You need to show some of your test work to the customer or want to place your own pet project. And you don't want to spend a lot of money and time on it. The service of [Vercel](vercel.com/) will come to your aid 

### Step - 1. Create new laravel project ?

You can create new laravel project using Laravel's CLI tool or past simple command 
to your terminal
```js
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel:^7.0 vercel-template
```

### Step - 2. Create 3 new files on project folder ?
1. `api/index.php` 
2. `vercel.json` 
3. `.vercelignore` 
4. Happy coding ðŸŽ‰ðŸ™Œ

## api/index.php
You need create folder with name `api` and create new file in this folder `index.php`.
In this file need put with code .

```js
<?php

// Forward Vercel requests to normal index.php
require __DIR__ . '/../public/index.php';
```
This code will help the Versel to perform everything in our public folder .

## .vercelignore
Need create new file in main project folder with name `.vercelignore` and put this code to folder
```js
/vendor
```
This comand means not load files inside direcory /vendor when we deploy our code.

## vercel.json
Create new file `vercel.json ` and put this code to file

```js
{
    "version": 2,
    "builds": [
        { "src": "/api/index.php", "use": "vercel-php@0.3.1" },
        { "src": "/public/**", "use": "@vercel/static" }
    ],
    "routes": [
        {
            "src": "/(css|js|images)/(.*)",
            "dest": "public/$1/$2"
        },
        {
            "src": "/(.*)",
            "dest": "/api/index.php"
        }
    ],
    "env": {
        "APP_CONFIG_CACHE": "/tmp/config.php",
        "APP_EVENTS_CACHE": "/tmp/events.php",
        "APP_PACKAGES_CACHE": "/tmp/packages.php",
        "APP_ROUTES_CACHE": "/tmp/routes.php",
        "APP_SERVICES_CACHE": "/tmp/services.php",
        "VIEW_COMPILED_PATH": "/tmp",

        "CACHE_DRIVER": "array",
        "LOG_CHANNEL": "stderr",
        "SESSION_DRIVER": "cookie"
    }
}

```
After all this stuf need to upload your project to Github or Bitbucket

### Login to Vercel and connect Git
